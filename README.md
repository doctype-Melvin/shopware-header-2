# Shopware Header

My second iteration of a code challenge that required me to write a header by following a design template.
This time I tried to take a more Shopware-like approach.

- extending blocks
- styling with bootstrap

This is not a pixel-perfect solution but that was not the point. It was all about learning how
to navigate through the Shopware folder structure, applying changes to Twig blocks and understanding a little bit more about the mechanisms behind the Shopware storefront.
